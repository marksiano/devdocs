Add *pad* kwarg to ax.set_title
-------------------------------

The method `axes.set_title` now has a *pad* kwarg, that specifies the
distance from the top of an axes to where the title is drawn.  The units
of *pad* is points, and the default is the value of the (already-existing)
``rcParams['axes.titlepad']``.
