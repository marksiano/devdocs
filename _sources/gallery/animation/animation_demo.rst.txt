pyplot animation
================

Generating an animation by calling `~.pyplot.pause` between plotting commands.

The method shown here is only suitable for simple, low-performance use.  For
more demanding applications, look at the :mod:`animation` module and the
examples that use it.

Note that calling `time.sleep` instead of `~.pyplot.pause` would *not* work.
